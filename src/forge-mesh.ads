--  Indexed triangle mesh: the one representation every operation reads
--  and writes. Bounded by discriminants, no heap in the kernel; the
--  session allocates meshes, the kernel only computes on them.
--
--  A solid is a mesh that is CLOSED (watertight) and CONSISTENTLY
--  ORIENTED (every triangle counter-clockwise seen from outside, so
--  every shared edge appears once in each direction). Is_Solid checks
--  both. Every operation in the kernel promises: solid in, solid out.
--
--  PROOF TARGET (the "proven geometry" of the project, v1 = topology)
--    M1  No index out of range anywhere (free with SPARK once the
--        Well_Formed predicate is a precondition).
--    M2  Is_Watertight is exactly "every directed edge has exactly one
--        reverse twin". State it as a ghost quantifier, prove the body.
--    M3  Primitives produce meshes with Is_Solid (box first).
--    M4  Transforms preserve Is_Solid (they touch vertices only; the
--        topology is untouched, so this is an equality proof on the
--        index arrays; note that a negative scale flips orientation).
--    M5  Volume of a solid is positive iff outward-oriented.

--     Execute (S, "box base 40 20 10", Response)
--
--  That is the whole API. The CLI reads lines from stdin and calls it.
--  The GUI builds a line when you click and calls it. An agent calls
--  it. A .forge file is lines; Load calls it once per line. Nothing
--  above this package touches the kernel directly, so nothing above
--  this package can do what a script cannot.
--
--  State = named solids + history of modeling commands. The solids are
--  always what you get by replaying the history from empty; Undo pops
--  the history and replays. O(n) per undo, obviously correct, and it
--  keeps the invariant "the text is the model" literally true.
--
--  Memory: meshes are heap-allocated here, and only here. The kernel
--  (Forge.Mesh and below) never allocates; it computes on meshes it is
--  handed. This package is a desktop program's business.
--
--  Read-back for renderers is Mesh_Of: a constant view of a named
--  solid. A GUI draws that; it does not edit it.

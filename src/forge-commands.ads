--  The command language. One line, one operation. This is the whole
--  interface between the engine and everything above it: the CLI reads
--  lines from stdin, a .forge file is lines, the GUI emits lines when
--  you click, an agent emits lines when it reasons. Parse and Image
--  are inverses; Commands_Round_Trip in tests/ checks it.
--
--  Grammar (tokens separated by spaces, numbers as Ada reals or ints,
--  names are identifiers up to Max_Name):

--    translate  NAME DX DY DZ

--  exports and meta commands are not. Save writes the history; load
--  replays it. That is the document format: this grammar, in a file.

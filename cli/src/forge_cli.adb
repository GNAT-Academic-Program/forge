--  forge: the command-line front end.

--     forge_cli                 REPL on stdin, one response line per command
--     forge_cli part.forge      run a file, then keep reading stdin
--     forge_cli -c "box b 1 2 3" -c "info b"
--
--  This program contains no modeling logic. It reads lines, hands them
--  to Forge.Session.Execute, prints the response. That is the design:
--  the GUI is the same thing with a picture. An agent is the same thing
--  with a pipe.
--
--  Exit status is the number of failed commands, capped at 255, so a
--  script that goes wrong is visible to whatever ran it.
